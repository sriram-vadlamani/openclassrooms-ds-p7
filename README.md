### Contents
This repository contains all the code for training, testing and deploying a predictive model for "Prêt à dépenser" in order to predict if a client can or cannot repay his loan back with difficulties and it's probability.
A data drift report generated by Evidently can also be found in this repo alongside notebooks for exploratory analysis, training, feature engineering and hyper parameter optimization.

### API
The API along with the model for inference can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/openclassrooms-p7/api-client-loan).

### Dashboard
The interactive dashboard for this application is hosted [here](client-loan-dashboard-p7.streamlit.app/)
Click on it to access the dashboard.
Here are a few client IDs to test the dashboard with:

- 100005
- 100013
- 100067
- 100066

**Note**: The client information is editable so, feel free to play around by changing the client's income (for example) and see how it affects the decision taken by the model.
